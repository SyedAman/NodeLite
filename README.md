# NodeLite

NodeLite is an ultra-lightweight, highly modular Node.js-like runtime environment designed for building scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. It is intended for environments where memory and processing power are at a premium, or for educational purposes to understand the internals of server-side JavaScript execution. NodeLite aims to provide the core functionalities of Node.js with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and extensibility.

## Getting Started

To start using NodeLite, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Git
- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Python 3.x (for build scripts)
- CMake

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepository.com/NodeLite.git
cd NodeLite
```

Compile and build the project:

```bash
make build
```

To run a simple JavaScript file:

```bash
./nodelite yourscript.js
```

## Development

NodeLite is in early development stages and contributors are welcome. The project structure is designed to be modular, allowing for components to be easily added, modified, or replaced. The core components of NodeLite include:

- **libuv-lite**: A minimalistic version of libuv, focusing on the essential event loop and asynchronous I/O operations.
- **v8-lite**: A stripped-down version of the V8 engine for executing JavaScript. This will prioritize memory efficiency and modularity.
- **http-lite**: A lightweight implementation of the HTTP/HTTPS protocols, supporting basic server functionality.

### Building a Simple HTTP Server

```javascript
const http = require('http-lite');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/');
});
```

### Extending NodeLite

To add a new module to NodeLite, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory under `src/modules`.
2. Implement your module in C++ or JavaScript, adhering to the NodeLite module interface.
3. Add your module to the build system and documentation.

### Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to NodeLite are highly encouraged. Please follow these guidelines:

- Write clear, maintainable code.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for new features or modules.
- Submit pull requests with detailed descriptions of changes.
- Ensure your code passes all tests before submitting.
